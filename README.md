FishOps
===================

FishOps is an Android mobile application designed to help local fishermen of the Philippines in supporting sustainable fishing practices by giving them access to live maps and information on Marina Protected Areas (MPAs) in their area, provide real-time weather reports and alerts, remind them of their fishing laws, and provide contact information for regulation officials.

> **Some of the key features:**
> 
>  - Available in both English and Tagalog, depending on the language of the user's phone.
>  - Harnesses the power of Google's Maps API for pinpoint accuracy and location awareness.
>  - The Dark Sky Forecast API brings timely weather warnings from NOAA and other local authorities.
>  - No-nonsense regional laws and contact information for people that don't have time to read 50-page documents.
